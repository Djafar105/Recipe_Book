# Python Basics

## Introduction
* you can either work with python via live commands in a shell environment for example in data cam its ipython : interactive python one command at time #to_verify ,or you can creat an ensemble of commands in a text file with the format .py to give meaning to the language used

***
## Basic commands 
* print() : it outputs whatever in the bracket  on the screen 
* type(insert_name_variable) : it tells you the type of the variable
***
## Variables
### Operations 
* ***=*** : this allows to assign whatever you can imagine to a vriable example : height = 1.48 , 
### Types 
* Variables are the heart and the holy grail of python and any other language, with time it grew out to be more evident to make classify them into types for a smooth usage : 
	* **str** : short for string ,basically text , a line of characters, can be assigned to a variable via  "" or '' , also it can be percieved as a table , see , [[]]
	* **int** : short for integer non decimal number example : 5 , 5.0 is not integer
	* **float** : decimal number example : 5.2
	* **bool : short for boolean, a special one it basically stores binary logical values , True or False , also theres sth about True being 1 and False being 0 , this logical result is deduced upon prforming a logical operation , see [[]]
