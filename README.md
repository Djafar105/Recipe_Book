## Purpose

It is a personal recipe book composed of an *ensemble* of notes that accompany me throughout my increasingly complex projects.  
It serves as a reference, an externalization of my memory and cognitive process, and may also offer value to others exploring similar fields.  
Through this repository, I aim to go beyond traditional textbook-style summaries by developing a personal model for how scientific knowledge can be structured, interconnected, and retrieved.

## How Notes Are Taken

- **Initial draft:** After engaging with the material, I try to rewrite what I have acquired using my own words, analogies, and metaphors.  
- **Polishing:** Once the draft is complete, I refine/polish it with minimal invasivity on the structure via AI models like ChatGPT.

> Note: The notes are intentionally interconnected using the Zettelkasten technique, as an attempt to create a fluid and naturalistic representation of how thoughts organize and relate in the brain.

## How to Explore This Repository

This is not a finished product and likely never will be.  
You might consider it something close to an ancient architecture under continuous construction—an evolving network of interlinked concepts and theories ready to be interpreted at any point in time.  
You can also build on it and adopt it as your own personal companion on your learning journey.
