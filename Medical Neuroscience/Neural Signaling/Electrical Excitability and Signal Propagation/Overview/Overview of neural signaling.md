# Overview of neural signaling
- ## Introduction :
- nerurons , and biological material based structures in general , are poor conductors of electricity ! yet the neurological process is based on electricity conduction ! #weird
- #explanation : so basically what happened is that evolution has resulted in the creationg or lets say change of the concept of conductivity , neurons dont really conduct electricity in the classical understanding of an iron rod that conducts electricity , but rather they do so by a very complexe mechanism that kind of is based on temporary changes in the toatality of the structure of the neuron to make an analogy , we can think of a rod of plastic then we inject small bodies of iron throughout it , that would result in the plastic rod being conductive !, it will be explained later , hang on #waiting 
- so basically the how of acquiring of iron points (yes theyre not fixed to stick and go) is the basis of condcutivity , i ve learned that it has a very elegant mechanism , it has a protective mechanism #forwhat? called a threshold, that is if you simulate the neuron under it nothing happens , ofc except the natural phenomena of the increase or decrease of the tension in the منجنيق , but if you reach the threshold something very weird happens , the membrane kind of explodes letting in a lot of iron bodies , positive iron bodies , for a very brief amount of time , until it reaches a specefic level of positivity then (it pushes them back outside again ) #to_verify , we call this *all or none nature* its worth noting that the more we exceed the thresshold , the positivty level doesnt change that is the limit of the entering of positive iron bodies , but rather , this process repeats itself agin for a number of times associeted with the intensity of the stimulus ! we say *frequence modulation*  ![Pasted image 20250616094910](./images/Pasted%20image%2020250616094910.png) ^1ac9be
