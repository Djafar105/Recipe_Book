## Intro : 
* So this is basically the holy grail , what we did before will allow the understanding of this , .. how does signal (action potential) propagates ? :
* First off we need to clarify that there are 2 kinds of signals:
	* propageable one , the action potential
	* non propageable one that decays over a short distance , 
* there is a very curated mechnaism , subtle but beautiful , its all really based on the threshold concept , when it is reached , sodium channels will open --> inward current of visitors , sodium ions , these people would try and wonder around in every direction (two possible directions left or right XD) and each time they pass by a voltage sensitive channel they would initiate another entrance , 
* Rq : one group of sodium tourists **cannot** travel the totality of the axon , they need to go out again #to_verify during the post the refractory period during which pumps are working which represents  a : *protective 'no going back' mechanism* that makes it not possible for the tourists of next sodium channel to induce the reopening of the channel if they ever decided to go back 
* We can conclude that the flow of current (from fluid dynamics pov) is critical as to the signal transmission , so then the less resistance in the inside of the axon the better , so then the bigger the diameter of the axon the better (fluid mechanics thing)

## Myelination:
* it is when the axon is covered by an isolating sheat , in the covered (myelinated) zones , the myelin can either be origniated from : 
	* dendrocytes , in the central nerveous system 
	* shwann cell in the periphical nerveous system 
* each segment of myelin coverage is 1 mm in length #to_verify 
* no leakiness during these zones --> better flow --> faster transmission => more efficace than the non myelinated axons
* Myelination is better , we agree on that but , why , for sure leakiness is one problem , but i feel like there is more to it , is it perhaps because دخول الحمام موش كي خروجو ? like all the trffic of in and out flow of ions disrupt the mouvement of current along ? #wonder 
* two types of propagations : 
	* Saltatory propagation , in myelinated axons
	* Continue ? #to_verify

## Questions : 
* How come its possible to induse an action potential during the post refractory period when we havent yet reestablished the concentratration gradient of the K and Na ions ? #weird 
* In a non myelinated axon :
	* what is the fate of each group of supplementary Na ions that reaches the next channel, does it stay there ? or is it repulsed outside once it induces a new action potential ? if it does stay there why dont we see more than one action potential ?
	* why do we need a lot of channels , cant we force a myelinated axon behavior along the axon by concentrating the channells at specific places ? #wonder , is it because of leakiness or what ? #wonder 
* In a myelinated axon : 
	* why cant we mesure the current when it is in the myelin covered zone ?
	* while traveling for 1mm ! , normally after some distance the concentration gradient and everything would be reestablished at the channel starting point , wouldnt that create a void or some sort of pull back force that prevents the travelers from going forward ?
