Ohm's law (classical):
$$ V = I * R $$ In other words **current** *x* **resistance** *=* **voltage**

Conductance : 
$$ g = \frac{1}{R} $$
Ohm's law (new version):
$$ V = \frac{I}{g} $$
But in neuro it is more meangiful to think and approach it in this way:
$$ I = V * g $$
#why , #explanation : The current flow is the star of the show (Neural signaling) , this new version loudly expresses that : in order for it to be current flow there needs to be a driving force (V) and conductance , the greater these two are the greater current would be , but as a baseline , g > 0 and V > EÃ©q (nerst potential at the equilibrium )
Rq : $$ V = V_{memb} - V_{eq}$$
g , the conductance is voltage dependent , meaning , the more intense the stimuls is the more conductance we have , but:
* it is not linear #why 
* and it differs from ion to ion :
	* for Na there is the phenomene of inactivation that suggests a special mechanism that are yet to be uncovered  ![[Pasted image 20250720162400.png]]
	* For K  there is no inactivation phenomena 
* it is time dependent :
	* for Na it is limited to certain period , 
	* for K it is slow and takes time to reach peak  , for , the inactivation thing
