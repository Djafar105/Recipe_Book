# Ionic Basis of the Action Potential Part 2

## Physical laws applied in neuro

* ***Ohm's law (classical):**
$$ V = I * R $$ In other words **current** *x* **resistance** *=* **voltage**

* **Conductance :** 
$$ g = \frac{1}{R} $$
* **Ohm's law (new version):**
$$ V = \frac{I}{g} $$
	=>But in neuro it is more meangiful to think and approach it in this way:
$$ I = V * g $$

* #why , #explanation : The current flow is the star of the show (Neural signaling) , this new version loudly expresses that : in order for it to be current flow there needs to be a driving force (V) and conductance , the greater these two are the greater current would be , but as a baseline , g > 0 and V > EÃ©q (nerst potential at the equilibrium )

* Rq : $$ V(df) = V_{memb} - V_{eq}$$
* g , the conductance is voltage dependent , meaning , the more intense the stimulus is the more conductance we have , but:
	* It is not linear #why 
	* And it differs from ion to ion :
		* for Na there is the phenomena of inactivation that suggests a special mechanism that are yet to be uncovered   ![Pasted image 20250720162400.](./images/Pasted%20image%2020250720162400.png)
		* For K  there is no inactivation phenomena 
	* it is time dependent :
		* for Na it is limited to certain period , 
		* for K it is slow and takes time to reach peak  , for , the inactivation thing
