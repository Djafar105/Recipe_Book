# Ionic Basis of the Action Potential Part 1
## Intro : 
* In order to study the ionic basis of the action potential , scientists back in the day (1960s) studied the ion currents #why , so they used the squid's giant axon (very accessible and easy to manipulate), and a very basic electrical circuit,.. The membrane permiability is very much unstable which makes the readings at that time kind of difficult , thus they opted to stabilise the permiability by harnessing the 2nd[[Core Concepts in neuroscience]] , in other words , stabilising the membrane potential --> stabilising the membrane ion channels [[]] --> stabilising the membrane permiability

* **capacitive current** : known as artifact, its basically how the toality of the cell reacts when an immediate stimulus is apllied in order to recalibrate and stuf like that #weird 

* explanation of what Hodgkin-Huxley  did : 
	* They applied a gradient of stimulus and then recorded the flow of ions , it was at first instant kinda bizzare and weird but then when we ground our approach with some learned laws like the nerst equations etc , the picture starts to get more and more clear , attached their raw findings : *

	* if things are a bit blurred go back to fig 3.2
	* so lets start, they basically ,when looking at these allure , decided to go on and explain the ions responsible of each part instead of explaining the allure in itself #weird , so they looked at the attached pic and went : hmmm since the resting nerst potential of Na is +52 V then the early current is very likely caused by Na #weird ![[Pasted image 20250720153128.png]]
	* then they went on to further support this theory by , activly applying the منجنيق principle and then 2 by activly supressing and immobilising the flow of Na and K by toxins , results were nice as shown in the attached pics :

 ## Question corner :
 * Question: How come the inward means the positive ions entering the membrane and it is of a negative value and vice versa ?
 * Answer: So basically its a convention , inward is represented negativly and is the flow of the positive ions inside the cell , and outward is the flow of positive ions outside of the cell and is represented positivily
