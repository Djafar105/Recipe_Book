In order to study the ionic basis of the action potential , scientists back in the day (1960s) studied the ion currents #why , so they used the squid's giant axon , and a very basic electrical circuit , its very worth to note that the membrane permiability is very much unstable which makes the readings at that time kind of difficult , thus they opted to stabilise the permiability by harnessing the 2nd[[Core Concepts in neuroscience]] , in other words , stabilising the membrane potential -->stabilising the membrane permeability #weird

capacitive current : known as artifact #waiting , #explanation : its basically how the toality of the cell reacts when an immediate stimulus is apllied in order to recalibrate and stuf like that #weird 
outward and inward , how come the inward means the positive ions entering the membrane and it is of a negative value and vice versa #waiting , #explanation : so basically its a convention , inward is reresented negativly and is the flow of the positive ions inside the cell , and outward is the flow of positive ions outside of the cell 
* explanation of what hudkins did : 
	* they applied a gradient of stimulus and then recorded the flow of ions , it was at first instant kinda bizzare and weird but then when we ground our approach with some learned laws like the nerst equations etc , the picture starts to get more and more clear , attached their raw findings : *

	* if things are a bit blurred go back to fig 3.2
	* so lets start , so they basically when looking at these allure , decided to go on and explain the ions responsible of each part instead of explaining the allure in itself #weird , so the looked at the attached pic and went : hmmm since the resting nerst potential of Na is +52 V then the early current is very likely caused by Na #weird ![[Pasted image 20250720153128.png]]
	* so then they went on to further support this theory by , activly applying the منجنيق principle and then 2 by activly supressing and immobilising the flow of Na and K by toxins , results were nice as shown in the attached pics :
