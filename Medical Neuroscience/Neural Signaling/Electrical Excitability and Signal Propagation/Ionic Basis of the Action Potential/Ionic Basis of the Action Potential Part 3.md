The action potential is composed by three parts :
	1- The rising phase 
	2- The falling phase : reflects the refractory time caused by the **inactivation** phase of sodium (Na) conductance ( time needed to recreate the tension ((reloading the منجنيق))
	3- the undershoot caused by the sustained slow flow of potassium (K) (qst: during the overshoot its outward current flow right ? #to_verify ) , also it surpasses the resting potential since it is actually going near the nerst eq potential of K --> existence of a combo of ions yet to be tackled during the resting phase

The threshold : 
* reaching it means reaching a point of a membrane potential where:  $$ I_{Na} = I_{K}$$
Refractory phase : 
* Absolute refractory phase : during the falling phase of pa (inact of Na) --> no possible pa during this period 
* Relative refractory phase : during the undershoot ---> pa possible but needs stronger than usual stimulus to compensate for the undershoot 

## Flow of ions at different times :
### at rest : 
[K]i >>[K]o and [Na]i << [Na]o

vice versa with K , at first it would be leaving at an increasing speed , and then it would still be leaving but on increasingly decreasing speed 

Conlusion : so then how does the concentration level goes back to normal for both Na and K is there sth else going on or am i misunderstanding sth ? #wonder #to_verify
