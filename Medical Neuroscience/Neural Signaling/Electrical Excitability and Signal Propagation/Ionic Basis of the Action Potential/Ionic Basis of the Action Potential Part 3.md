# Ionic Basis of the Action Potential Part 3
## Overview on the timeline :
* The action potential is composed by three parts :
		1- The rising phase : during which the voltage dependent sodium channels opens up allowing for a rapid inward current
		2- The falling phase : reflects the refractory time caused by the **inactivation** phase of sodium (Na) conductance ( time needed to recreate the tension ((reloading the منجنيق))
		3- the undershoot caused by the sustained slow flow of potassium (K) (qst: during the overshoot its outward current flow right ? #to_verify #verifed ) , also it surpasses the resting potential since it is actually going near the nerst eq potential of K 
		--> existence of a combo of ions yet to be tackled during the resting phase

* The threshold : reaching it means reaching a point of a membrane potential where:  $$ I_{Na} = I_{K}$$
* Refractory phase : 
	* **Absolute refractory phase :** during the falling phase of pa (inact of Na) --> no possible pa during this period 
	* **Relative refractory phase :** during the undershoot ---> pa possible but needs stronger than usual stimulus to compensate for the undershoot

## Flow of ions at different times :
### At rest : 
* [K]i >>[K]o and [Na]i << [Na]o 
### During an action potential :

and vice versa with K , at first it would be leaving at an increasing speed , and then it would still be leaving but on increasingly decreasing speed 

***Conlusion :*** so then how does the concentration level goes back to normal for both Na and K is there sth else going on or am i misunderstanding sth ? #wonder #to_verify #verifed everything is detailed in [[Molecular Mechanisms of Action Potential Generation, part 2#^815511]]
