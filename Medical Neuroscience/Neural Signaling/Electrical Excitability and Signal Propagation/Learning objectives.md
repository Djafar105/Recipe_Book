## Overview of Neural Signaling

- [ ] Differentiate the resting membrane potential from the action potential.
    
- [ ] Describe one means for encoding information in the activity of neurons.
    

Ionic basis of the resting membrane potential (2 parts)

- Describe the concept of electrochemical equilibrium and relate this concept to the resting membrane potential of neurons.
    
- Explain why the permeability of the neuronal plasma membrane at rest to K+ and the concentration gradient of this ion across the neuronal plasma membrane account for the resting membrane potential of neurons.
    
- Use the Nernst equation to predict the resting membrane potential of neurons given knowledge of the concentration gradients of permeant ions.
    

Ionic basis of the action potential (3 parts)

- Use the Goldman (and Nernst) equations to predict the membrane potential of neurons given knowledge of the concentration gradients of ions and their relative permeabilities across the neuronal plasma membrane.
    
- Describe the ionic basis of the action potential in terms of the voltage- and time-dependant changes in ionic permeabilities that occur across the neuronal plasma membrane.
    
- Describe the driving force for current flow across the plasma membrane.
    
- With careful precision, relate the time course of changes in Na+ and K+ conductance to changes in membrane potential during the action potential.
    
- Characterize the refractory period for action potential generation.
    

Molecular mechanisms of the action potential (2 parts)

- Describe the molecular properties of sodium and potassium channels that explain the voltage- and time-dependent permeability changes underlying action potential generation.
    
- Describe the molecular mechanisms for establishing chemical gradients for sodium and potassium across the neuronal plasma membrane.
    

Propagation of the action potential

- Describe the ionic basis of the action potential in terms of the voltage- and time-dependent changes in ionic permeabilities that occur across the neuronal plasma membrane.
    
- Characterize the advantages of myelination for the conduction of an action potential along an axon.
