### Predicting the potential:
+ #### One ion case :
	- We will be using a simple version of the *Nerst equation* :
		- the original equation has a lot of factors , thus we do some assumptions concerning T° , farraday cste etc so that we are left at the end with : 
		- $$
	E= \frac{58}{z}*\frac{[Xo]}{[Xi]}
	$$
	
			+ Ex : equilibrium potential	for any ion	
			+ z : valence	of	the	permeant	ion	(electrical	charge)	
			+ [X]o : concentration	of	ion	“X”	outside	of	the	cell	
			+ [X]i : concentration	of	ion	“X”	inside	of	the	cell	
+ #### Multiple ions case :
	+ We will be using the *Goldman equation* which is an exetension of the nerst equation:
	- $$
	E= {58}{\log}*\frac{[P_{k}][K_{o}]+[P_{Na}][Na_{o}]+[P_{Cl}][Cl_{i}]}{[P_{k}][K_{i}]+[P_{Na}][Na_{i}]+[P_{Cl}][Cl_{o}]}
	$$
- the way the membrane work is that it basically oppose to the gradients of concentration of ions , that is to say , can be done in two ways , either you classically oppose it by going directly against the stream OR by activly supporting it too much until it want to go the classical against stream direct , now its the same with the neuronic membrane , admitting that at the begining the inside is clear of any ions , it will block the passage of sodium ion(classic opposition) , and actually supports the passage of potassium way past the aquilibrium (not very intuitive way of opposing), until it reachs the rest potential of the membrane which can be described byt the goldman equation as very close to the potential of potassium accoding to nerst , or to the one of sodium during action potential , #to_verify 
- we ve ingnored Cl cuz for now its permeability during all time is 0
- ![[Pasted image 20250620082056.png]]
- this figure describes the permeability of the membrane throughout time , you see , at rest the permiability of potassium '*K*' is very much greater than '*Na*' --but that dosent mean that the permiability of K is actually great , in matter of fact its actually small , thats is because at the rest , very few ions go outside the membrane , and almost 0 of Na enters
- depending on the context , permiability can have two meanings : potentiel to got inout(K) or outin(Na) , in a normal pumàp behavior ?? and then reverse ?? #weird
