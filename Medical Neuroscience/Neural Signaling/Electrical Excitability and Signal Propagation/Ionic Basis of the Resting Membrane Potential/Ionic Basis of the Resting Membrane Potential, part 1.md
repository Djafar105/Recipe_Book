# Ionic Basis of the Resting Membrane Potential, part 1
 * ## Origin of electricity : 
	- ### Intro:
		-  there are core concepts for neuroscience , in this part we'll be tackeling [concept number 2](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=Medical%20Neuroscience%2FCore%20Concepts%20in%20neuroscience) 
		- A membrane potential is measured as follows : ~~V_out - V_in~~ #to_verify #verifed : V_in-V_out
		- So basically, in the exterior environment  that is  out of the cell, there are ions , K+ ions , potassium ions , the membrane opposes to the force resultant form the nature driven instinct to achieve equilibrium , in other words , the osmosse phenomena in a plant descrives how water moves , naturally and without any energy -here we say *active and passive movement*, from the milieu the most concentrated to the one with least concentration now going back to the neuron , its goal is to preserve the tension of the منجنيق, thus it will be __actively__ opposing to the wanted movements of ions from the outside-->inside , by activly transporting the inside ions to the outside via structure called:
	- ### PUMPS:
		- this system is still ambiguous for there are still things to uncover as this explanation describes a monocyclic fashion whish is very #weird and doesent feel right #hypothesis : i think its cyclic , ions goes out , then perhaps the role of the pump is reversed or i dunno #waiting #explanation : you almost got it ! , so basically it is very much cyclic but it is only reversed at a unity level not genrally , in other words there is not , phase a : outward activity and opposit with phase b but rather at each cycle there are outward then it gets reversed for inward and so on , check more details here [[Molecular Mechanisms of Action Potential Generation, part 2#^83bb4e]]

	- ### The channel: 
		- , a passive transporter that actually allows for the respect of the concentration gradient , i dont really now why it exists , #hypothesis: a buffer system ? #waiting #clarification : not quite right , this is my froend the holy grail oof signal transmission see [[Molecular Mechanisms of Action Potential Generation, part 1]]

	- ### Jots :
		- #hypothesis : i think by definition , the out environment is constant , that is zero ? , so like when we talk about moving ions from the inside of the cell outward , its like just throwing things in a blackhole , there are no consequences whatsover as for the effecgts on the outside world , so were onlyu decreasing or increasing the concentration of the inside par rapport a constant outside . #to_verify 
		- I #wonder if there is a natural electric balance driven equilibrium apart from this chemichal one , or , are they actually linked ? like the chemical  equilibrium results in an electrical one ?, i feel like this relates to [concept number 2](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=Medical%20Neuroscience%2FCore%20Concepts%20in%20neuroscience) 
		- The lograithmic equation of nerst hides sth as to the nature of this dance , i dunno what it is but i can feel it , yesss , very weird behavior
