- ## Origin of electriciyty : 
	- ### Intro:
		-  there are core concepts for neuroscience #waiting , in this part we'll be tackeling [concept number 2](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=Medical%20Neuroscience%2FCore%20Concepts%20in%20neuroscience) 
		- A membrane potential is measured as follows : ~~V_out - V_in~~ #to_verify #verifed : V_in-V_out
		- so basically, in the exterior environment  that is  out of the cell, there are ions , K+ ions , potassium ions , the membrane opposes to the force resultant form the nature driven instinct to achieve equilibrium , in other words , the osmosse phenomena in a plant descrives how water moves , naturally and without any energy -here we say *active and passive movement*, from the milieu the most concentrated to the one with least concentration now going back to the neuron , its goal is to preserve the tension of the منجنيق, thus it will be __actively__ opposing to the wanted movements of ions from the outside-->inside , by activly transporting the inside ions to the outside via structure called:
	- ### PUMPS:
		- this system is still ambiguous for there are still things to uncover as this explanation describes a monocyclic fashion whish is very #weird and doesent feel right #hypothesis : i think its cyclic , ions goes out , then perhaps the role of the pump is reversed or i dunno #waiting ![[Pasted image 20250617094306.png]]
		- there is also another structure of transportation :
	- ### The channel: 
		- , a passive transporter that actually allows for the respect of the concentration gradient , i dont really now why it exists , #hypothesis: a buffer system ? #waiting ![[Pasted image 20250617094417.png]]
		
	- ### Jots :
		- #hypothesis : i think by definition , the out environment is constant , that is zero ? , so like when we talk about moving ions from the inside of the cell outward , its like just throwing things in a blackhole , there are no consequences whatsover as for the effecgts on the outside world , so were onlyu decreasing or increasing the concentration of the inside par rapport a constant outside . #to_verify 
		- I #wonder if there is natural electric balance driven equilibrium apart from this chemichal one , or , are they actually linked ? like the chemical  equilibrium rrsults in an electrical one ?
		- note: the lograithmic equation of nerst hides sth as to the nature of this dance , i dunno what it is but i can feel it , yesss , very weird behavior
