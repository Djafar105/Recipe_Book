In this part we aregoing to tackle the post action potential phase , how the gradients of ions are restored , .. so basically it is done via pumps , a complexe machinery that has various types and versions see attached photo 
in order to study the mechanism of such machinery , we basically aimed to stabilise everything and then mess with the parameters one at a time, .. we took a case of ~~sodium~~ -->sodium/potassium pump and as shown in the attached photo , we can observe 3 things : 
* Potassium , somehow affects the sodium's pump activity (from the first peak) #weird
* The pump is heavely energy dependent (concluded from the introduction of the toxin)
* Somehow it appears that the pump did not care about the manipulations we did , meaning that when restored standard conditions it was as if nothing happened and the linear progression in relation with time was very much preserved #why #weird

* Next,.. we had the opportunity to actually understand how this happen on a molucular level , it turned out that it is cylic and is heavily based on 2 things:
	* the protein (pump) conformation , basically two possible conformations : inward and outward
	* energy consumptions , fixation of the **ATP** and phosphorylation etc 
	so basically first the sodium (3 atoms to be exact) are fixed on the protein , then the atp is fixed --> phosphorylation ---> change of conformation : inward to outward , sodium atoms are released and guess what , the potassium ions on the outside wil vling on the protein(2 atoms to be exact) when the energy wears out , th eprotein returns to the initial conformaton : inward and the potassiums can no longer stay fixed so they are released ==> 3 ions of Na are moved to the outside and 2 K are moved to the inside 
	==> a lil bit of inbalance 3 to 2 , but negligeable (almost most of the time) since sometime it can create a current that affects the resting potential
