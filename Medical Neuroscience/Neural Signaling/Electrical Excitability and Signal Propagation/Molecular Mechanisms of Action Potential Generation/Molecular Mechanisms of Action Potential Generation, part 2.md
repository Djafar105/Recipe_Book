# Molecular Mechanisms of Action Potential Generation, part 2
## Introduction
* In this part we are going to tackle the post action potential phase , how the gradients of ions are restored and the vital role of pumps in this process, tha later are a complexe machinery that has various types and versions :

## Breakdown 
* In order to study the mechanism of such machinery , we basically aimed to stabilise everything and then mess with the parameters one at a time, .. we took a sodium/potassium pump and as shown in Figure 4.11 , we can observe 3 things :  
* Potassium , somehow affects the sodium's pump activity (from the first peak) #weird
* The pump is heavily energy dependent (concluded from the introduction of the toxin)
* Somehow it appears that the pump did not care about the manipulations we did , meaning that when restored standard conditions it was as if nothing happened and the linear progression in relation with time was very much preserved #why #weird

* Next,.. we had the opportunity to actually understand how this happen on a molucular level , it turned out that it is cylic and is heavily based on 2 things: ^83bb4e
	* The protein (pump) conformation , basically two possible conformations : inward and outward
	* Energy consumptions , fixation of the **ATP** and phosphorylation etc..
	
	* So basically first the sodium (3 atoms to be exact) are fixed on the protein , then the atp is fixed --> phosphorylation ---> change of conformation : inward to outward , sodium atoms are released and guess what , the potassium ions on the outside wil vling on the protein(2 atoms to be exact) when the energy wears out , th eprotein returns to the initial conformaton : inward and the potassiums can no longer stay fixed so they are released ==> 3 ions of Na are moved to the outside and 2 K are moved to the inside 
		==> a lil bit of inbalance 3 to 2 , but negligeable (almost most of the time) since sometime it can create a current that affects the resting potential
