# Molecular Mechanisms of Action Potential Generation, part 1

Warnings :
* ****Pumps and voltage dependent channels are too different things !!***
* ****Voltage gated channels behavior is random at the unity scale ! group sturdy of neurons is needed to establish statistical models, we dont know for sure. !

## K/Na voltage dependent channel mechanism : 
* On a general blueprint they share the same structure and actually behave in the same way (they close at the same time), except the sodium one has a closing door that results in it to be percieved as something that closes fast , it is though but not really , youll see in the attached photo what i mean 
* The finite structure is different resulting in different statistical approaches, the K channels have less probability to open in response to stimuli thus the apeearing slow conductance evolution , and the opposite with Na 
* When Na gates closes , the only percieved action is the outward slow flow of potassium (K)--> origin of the undershoot phase

* Channels are complicated and diversed , there are not only voltage dependent :

* ### MÃ©chanisme d'action :
* These channels have a voltage sensitivity unit (colored in yellow) , charged + for K and Na , when at rest it be facing inward (closed) since the inside is more negative than the outside and when positive current passes by , a repulsion would take place , pushing the these two regions outward (opened) allowing for the passage of ion through pore
