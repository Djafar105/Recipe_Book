# Intro 
Metabotropic receptors, trigger intracellular signaling cascades upon neurotransmitter binding. These pathways involve second messengers (e.g., cAMP, IPâ‚ƒ) and can lead to indirect modulation or activation of ion channels or they can affect other cellular mechanisms  [[Example of cellular mechanisms Modulating gene expression]]
