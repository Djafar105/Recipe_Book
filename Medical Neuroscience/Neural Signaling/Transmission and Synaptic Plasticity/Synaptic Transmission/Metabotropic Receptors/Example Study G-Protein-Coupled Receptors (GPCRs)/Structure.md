# Structure 
Metabotropic receptors such as GPCRs are membrane-bound proteins characterized by seven transmembrane α-helices. Unlike [[Example The nicotine acetylcholine receptors]], they do **not** form an ion-conducting pore. Instead, their intracellular domain interacts with a protein complex, which is activated upon neurotransmitter binding to the extracellular domain.
