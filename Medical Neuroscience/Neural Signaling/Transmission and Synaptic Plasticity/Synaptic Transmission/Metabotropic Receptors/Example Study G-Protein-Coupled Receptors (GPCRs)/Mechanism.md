### Activity 
The cytoplasmic protein complex of metabotropic receptors can either be monomeric (one single protein) or heterotrimeric (more than one )

The machinery triggered by neurotransmitter binding can be seen as a micro cycle of activation, amplification or deamplification of the signal
	The activation targets structures responsible for second messenger production, which are often used as representatives for signal intensity

* But lets take a pause here, 
	* From a relative standpoint, signal intensity is _static_—unchangeable once the signal is created. That is: a single molecule of dopamine, once bound, initiates a cascade that might lead to the creation of, say, a hundred cAMP molecules. But whether there are 10 or 100 at the end is irrelevant **in this framing**.  
		==>What matters is the quantity at the origin: **1 dopamine molecule = the signal.**
	* From another standpoint, where each downstream molecule is treated independently with no "paternal" origin, we find that signal intensity does change depending on the number of messengers produced since Each molecule is its own unit of effect
		==>Yes, we can speak of amplification or deamplification.
