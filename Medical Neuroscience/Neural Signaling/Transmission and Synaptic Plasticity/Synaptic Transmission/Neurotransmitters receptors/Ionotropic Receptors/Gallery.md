>*FIGURE 5.18* **Na+ and K+ movements during EPCs and EPPs.** 
>(Aâ€“D) Each of the postsynaptic potentials indicated at the left results in different relative fluxes of Na+ and K+ (net ion fluxes). These ion fluxes determine the amplitude and polarity of the EPCs, which in turn determine the EPPs. Note that at about 0 mV the Na+ flux is exactly balanced by an opposite K+ flux, resulting in no net current flow, and hence no change in the membrane potential. (E) EPCs are inward at potentials more negative than Erev and outward at potentials more positive than Erev. (F) EPPs depolarize the postsynaptic cell at potentials more negative than Erev. At potentials more positive than Erev, EPPs hyperpolarize the cell.
