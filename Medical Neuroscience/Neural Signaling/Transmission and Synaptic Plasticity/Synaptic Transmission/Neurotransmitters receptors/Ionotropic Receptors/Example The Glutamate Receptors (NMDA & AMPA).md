# Example: The Glutamate Receptors (NMDA & AMPA)
* These are two examples of receptors with affinity for glutamate. However, as illustrated below, they behave quite differently in response to the same ligand.

	==>When glutamate is bound, AMPA receptors exhibit a rapid current flux. In contrast, NMDA receptors respond more slowly. This difference arises from the structural properties of NMDA receptors, partially due to the presence of Mg²⁺ ions in the channel pore.
* When the membrane is clamped or simply is at a very negative voltage, **Mg²⁺ acts as a physical blocker** of the NMDA channel, even if glutamate is already bound. The pore remains non-conductive because the Mg²⁺ ion is stabilized by the **negative internal potential**.  ^4dbff1
* The only way to relieve this block is to **depolarize the membrane**. When the membrane becomes sufficiently less negative (i.e., depolarized), the **electrostatic force becomes repulsive enough to expel Mg²⁺** from the channel pore, thus permitting ion flux.I wonder if this is why it takes more time for an NMDA receptor neuron to respond compared to AMPA #wonder #to_verify 
	* The depolarization is often caused by neighbor AMPA receptors [[Potentiation Mechanisms (Glutamate NMDA & AMPA receptors)#^09c7e5]]

>Distinction: Depolarization is not the membrane becoming positive, but rather becoming more positive, in this case, it doesn't necessarily need to reach a net-positive voltage. Rather, **the membrane just needs to be depolarized enough** so that the internal potential no longer retains the Mg²⁺ inside the pore, in other words enoug internal cations to repell Mg²⁺ ^67b664
