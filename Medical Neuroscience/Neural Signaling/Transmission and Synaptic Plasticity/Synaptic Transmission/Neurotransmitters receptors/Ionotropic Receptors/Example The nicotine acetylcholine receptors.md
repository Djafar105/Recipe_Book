# Example : The nicotine acetylcholine receptors 
Generally, a receptor is formed by the assembly of multiple **subunits**. Different subunit combinations = different versions of the same receptor family. These versions can differ in their: ^1292a5
* **affinity to the neurotransmitter**
* how they’re **modulated**
* how fast they **open and close** (aka kinetics).

	> (F) A diversity of subunits come together to form ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors. (A–C from Unwin, 2005; D,E from Miyazawa et al., 2003.)
	
Each subunit is built from regions that can be classified into three parts (based on location):
- **Extracellular** : the place of the **neurotransmitter binding site** (is the NT binding site _always_ in this region?  #wonder)
- **Plasma membrane** 
- **Cytoplasmic** — includes the terminal regions, which can interact with intracellular metabolites

> Ion channels dependent on the receptors are not as selective as the voltage gated one thus multiple ions can pass through.
