# Vesicle lifecycle 
## Intro 
* The vesicle membrane is principally composed of : **Synaptotagmin** & **Synaptobrevin** [[#^658788]]
* the presynaptic membrane is principally composed of : **SNAP-25**, **Syntaxin** and **Ca2+ channels**
## The cycle 
* Docking: basically the formation of the SNARE  complex  that retracts and so pulls the vesicle membrane closer t the axon membrane 
* Priming + Fusion #to_verify : when Ca2+ enters it attaches to **Synaptotagmin** resulting in changes in the conformity of the membrane thus catalyzing the fusion of the membrane resulting in the creation of pores like structure --> exocytosis

* Coating : Adaptor protein connects a network of **clathrin** (resembles *mocht* structure = clathrin triskelia) to the membrane , the triskelia envelops the loose vesicle in an endocytose fashion ^90ef92
* Budding: **Dynamin** pinches encloses the overture by pinching it off --> a closed empty vesicle with somewhat of a capsule structure 
* Uncoating : Under the action of **Hsc-70** and **auxilin**, the triskelia is disassembled leaving an intact vesicle ready for action again
