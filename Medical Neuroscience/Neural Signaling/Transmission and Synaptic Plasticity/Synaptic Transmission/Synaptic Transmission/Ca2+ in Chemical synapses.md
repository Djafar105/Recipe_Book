# Ca2+ in Chemical synapses
## Intro 
* the following writing explains the logic used when trying to prove the importance of Ca2+ in chemical synapses 
* The set of experiments was done on a giant squid, a very practical test subject [[Ionic Basis of the Action Potential Part 1#^de2c3b]]
Logical flow : 
* 1- Isolation of a  set of synapsing junctions 
* 2- [[Ionic Basis of the Action Potential Part 1#^9c3666]] the presynaptic axon and insert a reading electrode on the post synaptic axon
* 3- Do the set of experiments : basically each experiment you'll need a control subject and the one manipulated , in order to see the difference 
	* Experiment 1 : 
		* Block the Ca2+ channels in the presynaptic axon via injection of a specific compound 
		* Induce an artificial signal in the presynaptic membrane
		* Record the current of Ca2+ , and the membrane potential at the pre&post synaptic membrane

	* Experiment 2 : 
		* Inject Ca2+ directly 
		* record the readings in the post synaptic membrane

	* Experiment 3 :
		* repeat experiment 1 but this time inject a Ca2+ chelator (something that absorbs Ca in a way #to_verify )

## Questions : 
1- Why the need to do experiment 2 and 3 , 1 appears to be enough that calcium in indispensable ?
