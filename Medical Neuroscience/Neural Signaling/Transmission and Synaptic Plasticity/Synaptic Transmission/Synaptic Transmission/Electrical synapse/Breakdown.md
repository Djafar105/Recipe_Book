## Breakdown 
* How this happen:  It is based on the same almost mechanism of signal transmission along the axon, the whole process is based on the concentration gradient influence [[Overview of neural signaling#^1ac9be]]:
	* 1- Two membranes (location: dendrite-dendrite/soma or soma-soma ) superpose (Fig 5.2 A&B)
	* 2- =>Creation of tunnel like protein structures called **==connexons==** formed by two channels (Fig 5.2 C&D)
	* 3- => Free passage of ions (and some other molecules like ATP)
	* 4- => creation of electrical current [[Et>Ch stt]] => the signal is transmitted !! 
	> Note : 
	* **No directionality in the passage of ions** : The direction is solely dependent on the concentration gradient at that moment
