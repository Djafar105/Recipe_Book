# Steps (*marche arriÃ¨re*)
* 1- The vesicle is constructed by the result of action of many organelle
* 2- The neurotransmitter is recycled via the glial cell (astrocyte) [[astrocyte role]] or destructed via enzymes [[Recycling enzymes]]
* 3- The Nt is released 
* 4-the Nt is fixed on the receptors associated to the ion channels allowing for the movement of current  => signal transmission 
	* the results and effects of this fixation are the holygrail to how the NS works , it depends on many factors and will be tackled in great detail  
* 5-Nt diffuses through the cleft
* 6-Nt release into the cleft by exocytosis of the vesicles 
* 7-Under the passage of signal (AP), voltage gated Calcium channels opens allowing for the entrance of Ca ions inducing the : 
* 8- Vesicles approach and fuse to the critical part of the membrane implied in the synapse

>Rq : The probability for the signal transmission in a chemical transmission in the brain is around 5-10 % compared to almost 100% in electrical , this is validated from an evolutionary perspective [[evolution st]]
> Rq : This process is unidirectional but it is possible to find retrograde signals in the presynaptic compartment #explanation there are some transmitters receptors in the membrane of the presynaptic cell)
