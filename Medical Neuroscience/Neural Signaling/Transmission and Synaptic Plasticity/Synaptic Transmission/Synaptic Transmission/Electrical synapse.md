# Electrical synapse

* This is the most common type of synapse during embryogenesis 
* It is a very rapid way of transmitting signals almost instantaneous (A):

	=> this rapidity is very useful and crucial for when we need synchronized mass firing up of signal (B), 
		eg: In the hypothalamus we need this kind of synaptic transmission when there is the task of secreting substances in the bloodstream[[]]
* How this happen:  It is based on the same almost mechanism of signal transmission along the axon [[]] , the whole process is based on the concentration gradient influence [[]]:
	* 1- two membranes (location: dendrite-dendrite/soma or soma-soma ), kiss each other (superpose) (A&B)
	* 2- =>creation of tunnel like protein structures called **connexons** formed by two channels (C&D)
	* 3- =>free pass of ions (and some other molecules too like ATP)
	* 4- => creation of electrical current => the signal is transmitted !! 
	> Rq : 
	* no directionality in the passage of ions they direction is solely dependent on the concentration gradient at that moment
