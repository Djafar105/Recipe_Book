# Lifecycle of a Neurotransmitter
## Small Molecue Nt
* They’re synthesized right at the axon terminal, packed into vesicles, and positioned **close to the active zone** of the synapse. This closeness results in them needing a **relatively small Ca²⁺ influx** to trigger vesicle fusion and release.
* After usage , the SM Nt can either :
	* Diffuse away from the synaptic cleft
	* Degraded by certain enzymes , then some are discarded and some (preursors) return inside the neurone 
	* Stored in glial cells ( astrocytes)  then reintroduced to the neurone [[glutamat example]]

## Peptide Nt
* They’re synthesized in the cell body, processed through the endoplasmic reticulum like any other protein, then packaged into vesicles and shipped down the axon. Along the way, they can undergo cleavages or modifications.
* When they finally reach the terminal, they just kind of hang out, not tightly docked like small molecule NTs. That means they sit farther from the active zone, so it takes a larger Ca²⁺ influx to trigger their release.
* After their usage they can either :
	* Diffuse away from the synaptic cleft
	* Cleaved by proteases enzymes found in the cleft

## Examples 
### Glutamate 
* Glutamate is derived from a substance called **glutamine** basically via the action of an enzyme called glutaminase (substitution of  the amide group with hydroxyl)
* Once the glutamate is formed it gets stored into vesicle and released into the synaptic cleft
* After release it can :
	* diffuse away 
	* Re-enters the neuron for recycling 
	* enters nearby glial cells (astrocytes) in which it get transformed back into glutamine via the action of an enzyme called **glutamine transferase** 
		* Glutamine is then shipped back to the neuron 
### Acetylcholine
