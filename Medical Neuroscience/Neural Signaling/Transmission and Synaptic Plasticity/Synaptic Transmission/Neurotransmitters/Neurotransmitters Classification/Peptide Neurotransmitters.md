# Peptide Neurotransmitters
These are a sequence of amino acides, usually containing between 3 and 36 amino acids. The sequence of amino acids determines the biological activity of each peptide.

## Opioid peptides 
* These peptides have a rather hallucinogenic effects in the brain #to_verify(all or only enkephalin) , their receptors are found in the spinal chord
