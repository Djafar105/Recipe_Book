# Synaptic summation 
* The postsynaptic membrane receives inputs from multiple presynaptic neurons simultaneously. Each input has its own signal intensity and type , either excitatory or inhibitory. These inputs generate synaptic currents that flow into the postsynaptic cell and merge. The result is a hybrid postsynaptic potential, shaped by an algebraic summation of the individual signal amplitudes.
