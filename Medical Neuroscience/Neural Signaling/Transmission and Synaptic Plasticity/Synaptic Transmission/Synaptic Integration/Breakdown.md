# Breakdown 
* First off, we need to clarify the concept of **reversal potential** . It can be described as the Nernst equilibrium potential for one or multiple ions to which a membrane channel is selective. This **E<sub>rev</sub>** is directly determined by the concentration gradient, the relative fraction of ion concentrations inside and outside the cell [[Ionic Basis of the Resting Membrane Potential, part 2]]. So, in effect, this potential acts as a **barrier**, a ***seuil***: ^fba33f
	- Relative to the resting membrane potential, **E<sub>rev</sub>** can act as either the **limit of depolarization** (if it's above resting potential) or the **limit of hyperpolarization** (if it's below it).
	- Past this point, no flux is possible in the “normal” way.
- Whether a post-synaptic potential qualifies as an **EPSP** or **IPSP** [[Jargon]] is heavily dependent on whether the **E<sub>rev</sub>** is above or below the **action potential threshold** at the moment the potential is generated:
	- If **E<sub>rev</sub>** is above threshold, the cell can theoretically reach it —> this is an **EPSP**.
	- If it's below threshold, it acts as a hyperpolarizing force —> an **IPSP**.
* A neurotransmitter can have **excitatory** or **inhibitory** effects — it depends on the **concentration gradient** (and the receptor too but it all falls back to the concentration), not on the molecule itself.
	==> A strong example is **GABA**: long known to be inhibitory by nature, it can in fact exert excitatory effects in **immature neurons** (as shown in mice, and likely in humans too). ^7e633e
	- Mechanistically, GABA channels are **Cl⁻-selective** : in **mature neurons**, intracellular Cl⁻ is **lower** than outside, due to the presence of an extrusion pump that actively removes Cl⁻. And In **immature neurons**, a different transporter actively **imports** Cl⁻ into the cell, reversing the gradient. As a result, **E<sub>Cl⁻eq</sub>** = **E<sub>rev</sub>** lies **above** the threshold ==>GABA becomes **excitatory**, not inhibitory.
