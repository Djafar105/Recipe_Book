# Overview 
## Manifesto 
So, we’ve been thinking of neurons and the nervous system as something strict and static and definite in structure — something predictable, something we can understand easily and control. You know: stimulus, ion channels open, action potential, pumps, etc., and that’s it. But it actually turned out — and what I’m about to say is valid from an evolutionary perspective [[more details here]]— quite the opposite, really. Yes, all these definite complex mechanisms are valid, but they’re actually just the basic functional layer, the base, to something rather crazy in complexity. It turns out the neurological machinery is an auto-learning system. Meaning that as a nervous system is born, everything is set to default, — we are all the same (of course not really the same due to slight/great changes in the “starter pack,” but architecturally speaking) — we are all at t₀. And then, to each one of us, a timeline. With each micro-event during this timeline — and what does “event” mean, really?: Basically, stimulus from the outside or inside environment we live in — the machinery changes itself to better adapt. Until death.

There’s a concept in probabilities and statistics called the “random walk.”[[5-Hacker statistics#^4f6e79]] You can see the forever-changing nature of the nervous system’s machinery as a kind of random walk. Each one of us is a random walk. Synaptic plasticity as the origin of diversity, and as the meaning-giver to individuality.
This topic, if understood — if we understand how plasticity works, how the brain interprets events, how it changes structure — could lead to unlimited, unimaginable possibilities: helping guide the brain after traumatic events or physical injuries, addressing predispositions in the “starter pack” we mentioned, approaching forensics in new ways, and much, much more.
This is just, overwhelmingly epic.

## Practical Introduction 
### Context 
* In this submodule, we'll tackle fundamental terms in synaptic plasticity such as **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)** & **Long-Term Depression (LTD)**.
* Our work will be based on the 2nd , 4th and 8th [[Core Concepts in neuroscience]]

### Glimpse
Synaptic plasticity can be defined simply as the brain’s capacity to change, or more specifically by **when** and **where** it occurs, and its consequences for neuronal structure and function. 
* When : it an take place on both the short sale (msec->mins) [[Potentiation Mechanisms (Glutamate NMDA & AMPA receptors)]] or on the long scale (hours->lifetime) [[Example of cellular mechanisms Modulating gene expression]]
* Where (from specific to general): at individual synapses between neurons and glial cells) → within local circuits and networks → across large-scale systems such as the cortical motor network.
* Effects : plasticity results in the  adaptive processes, learning and memory, and the fine-tuning of cognitive and motor skills.
#### Final Take 
So, synaptic plasticity is based on specific patterns of neural activity (such as a tetanic signal) in the presynaptic neuron. This triggers a calcium-dependent intracellular mechanism in the postsynaptic neuron, which acts on the  protein structures (e.g., receptors) through the action of protein kinases (which phosphorylate proteins [[protein kinases st]]) and protein phosphatases (which dephosphorylate proteins [[protein phosphatases st]]). 
=> The result is a potentiation or depression of the postsynaptic neuron’s responsiveness.
	Updated sum-up : 
		1- Neural activation (synapse junction is active)
		2- Influx of Calcium 
		3- Activation of calcium dependent second messager system 
		4- Activation of protein kinases or phosphatases 
		5- Action of the later on the phosphorylation of protein activly incorporated in plasticity 
		NB : this is for early stage long term plasticity or depression , for the long stages , we need to altere the genes
