# Breakdown 
We'll continue studying one synapse at a time but this time we'll take into consideration everything around, so we have two possible scenarios: either the presynaptic neuron fires before another does at the post or the opposite, and note that we are always in the frame of ±10-20 ms max, anything out of that range is out of this context.
* If the pre fires before: this is good, normal course of actions, synapse activity, potentiation if the signal is intense enough [[Potentiation Mechanisms (Glutamate NMDA & AMPA receptors)]]

* If the post fires before: well here, we'll have depression instead, the synapse is even weakened by the mechanism seen in Long Term Depression : [[Mechanisms#^3bae61]]

⇒ Neurons are dramatic, and quite smart actually. If you hit in the close to correct time you'd be eliminated and outcasted for future interactions (LTD) which is wild in my opinion but actually valid from a developmental pov [[Cognitive Development Pause]]. This interesting behavior is covered by Hebb's postulate: [[Hebb's postulate]]
To sum up : **"Neurons that fire together, wire together"**
***
There is another common saying describing this behavior : "use it or lose it" , here is my personal take on it : 

At t=0, we start from no interactions between the two persons—no synapses, no junctions. Nothing happens yet. At t>0, assuming interactions take place, two possibilities emerge: if there is good chemistry and synchrony (neurons firing together) then wiring occurs, which is “using it.” Conversely, if miscommunications happen, the connection may weaken,  below t=0 baseline => LTD.

The key question is: how do we perceive t>0 if interactions didn’t actually occur? My take is this: if other neurons are waiting in line to take your place, then the potential wiring is lost making “use it or lose it” valid. But if these neurons exist alone in their neuronal universe, it becomes more like “use it or don’t.”
