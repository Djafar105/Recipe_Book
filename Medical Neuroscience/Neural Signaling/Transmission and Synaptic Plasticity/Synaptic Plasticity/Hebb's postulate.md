# Hebb's postulate 
 ***''When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased"***

## Clarification : 
It's really important to note that Hebb did not actually describe plasticity in its modern format [[Spike-Timing Dependent Synaptic Plasticity]] , but rather was so close and actually layed the foundation of the synaptic behavior for the researchers after him
