## Peculiar case : LTD in the cerebellum 

^e18512
### Intro
In the cerebellum there is the existence of a really fascinating neuronal architecture composed from : 
* Purkinje cells [[Detailed anatomy st]]
* Parallel fibers (PF) [[Detailed anatomy st]]
* Climbing fibers (CF)[[Detailed anatomy st]]
both the PFs and the CFs acts on the Purkinje cell and results in its depression via a very interesting mechanism.

### Breakdown 
* **Climbing fibers** form some of the most powerful excitatory synapses in the nervous system, producing a strong Ca²⁺ influx through voltage-gated calcium channels 
* **Parallel fibers**,  release glutamate at their presynaptic terminals, which binds to specific **metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)**[[Structure#^383303]] on the Purkinje cell. This initiates a targeted second messenger cascade that mobilizes calcium from intracellular stores (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum) into the cytosol.
	* ==> flood of internal calcium levels ==> activation of phosphorylation pathways that activates proteins that are actively involved in the **endocytosis of AMPA receptors** from the postsynaptic membrane into intracellular vesicles [[Mechanisms#^c44646]]==> decreased AMPA receptor density at the synapse ==> reduced postsynaptic responsiveness → **cerebellar #to_verify  LTD**.
