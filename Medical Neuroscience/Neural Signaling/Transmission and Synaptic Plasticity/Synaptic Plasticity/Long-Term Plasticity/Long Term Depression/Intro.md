# Intro
Synaptic Depression, interestingly enough, is based on essentially the same cellular machinery as potentiation [[Potentiation Mechanisms (Glutamate NMDA & AMPA receptors)]] just with some key changes in the conditions:
	1- Synaptic activation is needed ,

	2- low frequency (weak [[Overview of neural signaling#^1ac9be]]) stimulation instead of a tetanic one

> You can think of it as “luring” the neuron into potentiation  rather than exciting it into full potentiation. All of this description applies to the cerebral cortex (eg: in the cerebellum, things often tend flip [[Peculiar case  LTD in the cerebellum]]) .
