# Mechanisms 
* LTD mirrors LTP in its basic setup—both involve the pairing of AMPA and NMDA receptor activity [[Potentiation Mechanisms (Glutamate NMDA & AMPA receptors)#^09c7e5]]. The difference lies in the signal strength: in LTD, the stimulus is weak but still sufficient to depolarize the postsynaptic membrane enough to expel magnesium ions from NMDA channels, allowing a modest influx of Ca²⁺.
* This reduced calcium entry  activates second messenger pathways, such as protein phosphatases, which target protein structures that are actively involved for AMPA receptors removal from the postsynaptic membrane and reinsertion into cytoplasmic vesicles. I #wonder Is this the same mechanism as in the vesicle recycling [[Vesicle lifecycle#^90ef92]] ^c44646
	*  => fewer AMPA receptors at the synapse → reduced postsynaptic sensitivity → long-term depression.

	> (C) Mechanisms underlying LTD. A low-amplitude rise in Ca2+ concentration in the postsynaptic CA1 neuron activates postsynaptic protein phosphatases, which cause internalization of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, thereby decreasing the sensitivity to glutamate released from the Schaffer collateral terminals. (B after Mulkey et al., 1993.)
* **Summary:** ^3bae61
	- LTD still requires **synaptic activation** too; the distinction is in the **frequency and strength** of stimulation.
	- The **kinetics and amplitude** of Ca²⁺ influx (speed, magnitude) are critical in determining whether the outcome is potentiation or depression—though the exact effect remains context-dependent, as seen in the cerebellum [[#^e18512]].
