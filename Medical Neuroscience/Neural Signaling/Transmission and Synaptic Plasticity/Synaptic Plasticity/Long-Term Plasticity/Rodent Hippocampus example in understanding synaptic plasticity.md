* The following experiment was conducted to understand the plastic behavior of neurons. Rodents serve as the experimental model, and to clarify the methodological approach scientists employ when studying living systems: they sacrifice the animal then extract the desired neural tissue via dissection and finally perform experiments on the extracted tissue within a defined temporal window(few hours to one day). In this case, a rodent hippocampus was extracted and maintained in viable conditions for acute slice preparation, during which experiments were performed on the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synaptic pathway to investigate mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.

* Researchers isolate two parallel Schaffer collateral pathways, each synapsing onto the same CA1 neuronal population (forming two independent stimulation pathways within the same slice). They perform a series of stimulations and monitor how the postsynaptic neurons respond by recording excitatory postsynaptic potential EPSP. To highlight the concept of potentiation, they deliver a tetanic stimulus to one pathway, then stimulate both pathways independently after a defined interval and record the comparative responses.

* The results demonstrate that the pathway subjected to tetanic stimulation exhibits approximately doubled amplitude responses, while the control pathway maintains baseline levels. This differential response indicates that synaptic efficacy has been enhanced specifically at the stimulated synapses through activity-dependent structural and molecular modifications[[Potentiation Mechanisms (Glutamate NMDA & AMPA receptors)]].

* Long-term follow-up studies in living rodents reveal that these potentiated responses persist with remarkable stability over extended periods, showing only modest decrements over time. This, can actually give us a hint at how the brain learn.

	> *FIGURE 8.7* **LTP of Schaffer collateral–CA1 synapses.** 
	(A) Arrangement for recording synaptic transmission. Two stimulating electrodes (1 and 2) activate separate populations of Schaffer collaterals, providing test and control synaptic pathways. 
	(B) Left: Synaptic responses recorded in a CA1 neuron in response to single stimuli of synaptic pathway 1, minutes before and 1 hour after a high-frequency train of stimuli. The high-frequency stimulus train increases the size of the EPSP evoked by a single stimulus. Right: The size of the EPSP produced by stimulating synaptic pathway 2, which did not receive high-frequency stimulation, is unchanged. 
	(C) Time course of changes in the amplitude of EPSPs evoked by stimulation of pathways 1 and 2. High-frequency stimulation of pathway 1 (darker bar) enhances EPSPs in this pathway (purple dots). This LTP of synaptic transmission in pathway 1 persists for more than an hour, while the amplitude of EPSPs produced by pathway 2 (orange dots) remains constant. 
	(D) Recordings of EPSPs from the hippocampus in vivo reveal that high-frequency stimulation can produce LTP that lasts for more than 1 year. (A–C after Malinow et al., 1989; D from Abraham et al., 2002.)

* i have a question though : why does the control pathway fail to exhibit similar potentiation, given that both pathways target the same postsynaptic neuron population? If the postsynaptic CA1 neurons have already undergone calcium-mediated structural changes at their membrane surface as a consequence of tetanic stimulation, one would expect these modifications to affect all synaptic inputs equally. This apparent contradiction challenges my understanding of the spatial specificity of synaptic plasticity mechanisms. #weird especially in terms of associativity [[Propreties#^067ca0]]
