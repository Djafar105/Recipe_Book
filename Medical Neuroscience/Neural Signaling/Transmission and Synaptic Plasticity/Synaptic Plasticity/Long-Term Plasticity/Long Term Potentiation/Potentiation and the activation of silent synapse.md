## Potentiation and the activation of silent synapse 
* Silent synapses are characterized by the presence of only NMDA receptors on the postsynaptic spine surface, with little or no functional AMPA receptor expression. Under normal resting membrane potentials, a standard presynaptic stimulus elicits no detectable postsynaptic current because the NMDA channels are blocked by Mg²⁺. However, if the postsynaptic membrane is voltage-clamped [[Ionic Basis of the Action Potential Part 1#^9c3666]]at a depolarized potential—thereby repelling Mg²⁺—an outward current can be recorded, reflecting Na⁺ efflux and confirming synaptic functionality. These synapses are thus “silent” under baseline conditions and require activation, typically via high-frequency (tetanus) stimulation, to recruit AMPA receptors and become fully active.
