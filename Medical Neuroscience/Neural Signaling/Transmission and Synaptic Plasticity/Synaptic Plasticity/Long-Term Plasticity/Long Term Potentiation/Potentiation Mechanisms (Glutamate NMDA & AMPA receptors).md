# Potentiation Mechanisms (Glutamate NMDA & AMPA receptors) 

* NMDA receptors have an important feature, that is their non-selectivity among cations, this allows for the passage of calcium ions, but in order to do so there needs to be enough depolarization in the membrane from the resting membrane potential that is around -70mV, in order for the magnesium to be repelled .
* This depolarization is usually caused by fellow AMPA receptors nearby that are not really voltage-dependent but rather glutamate dependent, thus they result in the depolarization [[Example The Glutamate Receptors (NMDA & AMPA)#^67b664]]. ^09c7e5
*  Now here is the show: once calcium enters, it will act on second messenger kinase systems such as:
	* protein kinase C 
	* Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II. 
* Once activated, they will phosphorylate targeted proteins that are actively involved in the process of transporting AMPA receptors to the surface of the membrane
	==>Increasing in the number of receptors present ==> glutamate sensitivity of the neuron increases ==> long-term potentiation

* The previous was more of an immediate effect, incorporating second messenger systems. However, there is also a slower, long-term effect of calcium influx on long-term potentiation (LTP). Following activation of Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), the kinase interacts with membrane-associated protein structures, initiating a signaling cascade that ultimately activates the CREB transcription factor. CREB then triggers a cascade leading to the transcription of genes encoding synaptic growth-related proteins. 
	-->In essence, this long-term effect manifests as an increase in the number and stability of synaptic junctions
