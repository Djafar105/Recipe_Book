# Cool jazz
postwar infused art mouvement 
what i listened to so far :
there’s a **hierarchical way to think about music classification**, though it’s not rigid—genres can be fuzzy and overlapping. A typical hierarchy is something like this:

1. **Genre** – the broadest classification, often culturally defined. Examples: Jazz, Rock, Classical, Electronic, Exotica, Bossa Nova.
    
2. **Subgenre / Style** – a more specific subset within a genre, sometimes reflecting era, region, or distinctive characteristics. Examples: Cool Jazz, Bebop, Acid Jazz (all under Jazz); Samba-Influenced Bossa Nova (under Bossa Nova).
    
3. **Form / Type / Mood** – even more specific, capturing structure, instrumentation, or emotional quality. Examples: Ballad, Swing, Upbeat Dance, Lounge, Instrumental.
    
4. **Track-level Tags** – very granular, often used in digital libraries for search and recommendation: key, tempo, instrumentation, vocal/instrumental, vibe/mood descriptors.
    

So, a song can be labeled in multiple layers:

_Genre:_ Jazz → _Subgenre:_ Cool Jazz → _Form/Mood:_ Instrumental Swing → _Track-level tags:_ 120 bpm, piano-led, mellow, night-time vibe.
