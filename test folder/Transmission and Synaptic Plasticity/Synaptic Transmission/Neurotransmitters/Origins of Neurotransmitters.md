# Origins of Neurotransmitters
## Catecholamine
### Dopamine 
- **Cell bodies**: are found in two adjacent groups in the mid part of the brain 
	- ==**Substantia nigra pars compacta**== : collection of compact cells 
	- ==**Ventral tegmental area**== , so this is the origin , then from the susbstantia nigra they go up (basal ganglia : stratum) and down (spinal cord) basically . and from the ventral tegmental they go to prefrontal cortex area
- **Prolongation**: each group has specefic directions 
	- **Tegmental **: *vers* the frontal part of the brain : prefrontal cortex , amygdala , hypothalamus  #to_verify 
	- **Substantia nigra** : to both the spinal chord and to the stratum in the basal ganglia #to_verify #verifed

### Norepinephrine 

* **Cell bodies**: grouped in a structure called ==**locus coeruleus**== found in the dorsal parts of the pons [[anatomy ref]] , they have a blueish color 
* **Prolongation:** All around the brain but important thing to note is that they dont cross the basal ganlia but rather go around it #to_verify

### Epinephrine (adrenaline)
* **Cell bodies** : are found at the base of the pons in the medulla , generally few neurons contain epinephrine  
* **Prolongation:** stops at the thalamus and hypothalamus ![Epinephrine distribution .png](Epinephrine%20distribution%20.png)

**in the human brain.** 
Shown (A,B,C) are neurons and their projections (arrows) that contain catecholamine neurotransmitters. Curved arrows along the perimeter of the cortex indicate the innervation of lateral cortical regions not shown in this midsagittal plane of section.

## Indoleamine (serotonin) & Imidazoleamine (histamine)

### Serotonin
* **Cell bodies** : Are primarily found in two separate areas in  the midbrain:
	* ==**Raphe nuclei**==  : Most of serotonin cell bodies are found here
	* **Pons**
* **Prolongation** : each group has specefic directions 
	* ==**Raphe nuclei**== : Projected to quite the totality of the brain.
	* **Pons** : To the spinal chord

### Histamine 
* **Cell bodies** : are concentrated in one place , just under the thalamus, forming a structure called ==**Tuberomammillary nucleus of hypothalamus **==
* **Prolangation** : everywhere

>FIGURE 6.17 **The distribution of histamine and serotonin**
**neurotransmitters in the human brain.** Diagrams show the distribution of neurons and their projections (arrows) containing histamine (A) or serotonin (B). Curved arrows along the perimeter of the cortex indicate the innervation of lateral cortical regions not shown in this midsagittal plane of section.
