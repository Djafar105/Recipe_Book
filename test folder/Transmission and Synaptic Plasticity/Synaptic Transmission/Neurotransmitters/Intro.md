# Intro

* Neurotransmitters are substances , molecules by whom the status of channels ion channels [[ion channels]] is controlled in chemical synapse, they are grouped into 2 classes based on their size : **Small Molecule Nt** [[SMNt]] and **Peptide Nt** [[PNt]]
* Understanding the effects of a certain Nt requires the thorough understanding of their receptors on the postsynaptic membrane as a Nt can have diverse effects depending on the receptor it got fixed on
	* There are currently 2 types of receptors : **Ionotropic** [[Ionotropic receptors]] (designed solely for SMNt fixation) and **Metabotric** (designed mainly for PNt but SMNt can be fixed too[[metabotric receptors]]
	* Ionotropic receptor mechanism is quite straight forward #to_verify , a Nt get fixed then the channel opens thats it [[more details]]wheras  a metabotric receptor is slow due the fact that a fixation of a Nt declenches a metabolic process [[more details]] 
* It is worth mentioning that metabotric originated synapses are less frequent to happen compared to ionotropic , this can be explained by the nature of formation of Nt in the presynaptic membrane [[Ca2+ in pnt vesicle]]
