# Metabotropic Neurotransmitters
## Intro 
Metabotropic receptors, trigger intracellular signaling cascades upon neurotransmitter binding. These pathways involve second messengers (e.g., cAMP, IP₃) and can lead to indirect modulation or activation of ion channels or they can affect other cellular mechanisms  [[#^70e0b5]]

## Example Study: G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)
### Structure 
These receptors and all metabotropic ones in general have a similar structure to the embedded [[Ionotropic Receptors#^1292a5]] except they don't form a pore an the cytoplasmic part contain a complex of protein that gets activated once the Nt is fixed

## Example Study: G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)

### Structure

Metabotropic receptors such as GPCRs are membrane-bound proteins characterized by seven transmembrane α-helices. Unlike ionotropic receptors, they do **not** form an ion-conducting pore. Instead, their intracellular domain interacts with a protein complex, which is activated upon neurotransmitter binding to the extracellular domain.

### Activity 
The cytoplasmic protein complex of metabotropic receptors can either be monomeric (one single protein) or heterotrimeric (more than one )

The machinery triggered by neurotransmitter binding can be seen as a micro cycle of activation, amplification or deamplification of the signal
	The activation targets structures responsible for second messenger production, which are often used as representatives for signal intensity

* But lets take a pause here, 
	* From a relative standpoint, signal intensity is _static_—unchangeable once the signal is created. That is: a single molecule of dopamine, once bound, initiates a cascade that might lead to the creation of, say, a hundred cAMP molecules. But whether there are 10 or 100 at the end is irrelevant **in this framing**.  
		==>What matters is the quantity at the origin: **1 dopamine molecule = the signal.**
	* From another standpoint, where each downstream molecule is treated independently with no "paternal" origin, we find that signal intensity does change depending on the number of messengers produced since Each molecule is its own unit of effect
		==>Yes, we can speak of amplification or deamplification.

### Example of cellular mechanisms : Modulating gene expression

This is the resultant effect for the last messenger (of a chain cascades) action on the CREB region responsible of transcription in the DNA. Illustrated bellow are the diverse ways of doing so
