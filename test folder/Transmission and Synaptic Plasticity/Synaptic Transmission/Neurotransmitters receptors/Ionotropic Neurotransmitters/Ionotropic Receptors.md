# Ionotropic Receptors
## Intro 
The ionotropic receptors are a built in parts of a global structure : the ion channel protein 
> Understanding the effect of a Nt incorporate going further of merely understanding its identity to understanding both its receptors structures and their distribution alongside the post-synaptic membrane 

***
## Example : The nicotine acetylcholine receptors 
Generally, a receptor is formed by the assembly of multiple **subunits**. Different subunit combinations = different versions of the same receptor family. These versions can differ in their: ^1292a5
* **affinity to the neurotransmitter**
* how they’re **modulated**
* how fast they **open and close** (aka kinetics).

	> (F) A diversity of subunits come together to form ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors. (A–C from Unwin, 2005; D,E from Miyazawa et al., 2003.)
	
Each subunit is built from regions that can be classified into three parts (based on location):
- **Extracellular** : the place of the **neurotransmitter binding site** (is the NT binding site _always_ in this region?  #wonder)
- **Plasma membrane** 
- **Cytoplasmic** — includes the terminal regions, which can interact with intracellular metabolites

> Ion channels dependent on the receptors are not as selective as the voltage gated one thus multiple ions can pass through

## The current in relation to the driving force and conductance 
As stated by Ohm’s Law [[ohm law]], we can reapply the logic in the neuronal context with updated terms:
	$Psc = g*V_{df}$
* **PSC** = post-synaptic current 
* There is always a tendency to a state of equilibrium whether it is electrical or chemical, that is , if we clamp the membrane at a **very negative voltage**, then we will create resistance , a gradient , a need to restore balance of charge=concentration([[Core Concept in neuroscience]] ) either by letting go of negative charged ions or by letting in positive charged ions , it all depends on the selectivity of the ionotropic receptor 
* In the nAChRs case, the channel is selective to k+ and Na + so then At –100 mV, the driving force on Na⁺ is massive (since its Nernst equilibrium potential of sodium  is around +60 mV), so Na⁺ rushes _in_. K⁺, with a Nernst equilibrium potential around –90 mV, has a smaller outward driving force—so its efflux is much weaker. Na⁺ dominates the inward current at that voltage.

* One more note: at 0mv it appears to be nothing is happening, in fact it could be possible that  there is it is just a state of equilibrium inward current =  outward current ..
* This happens when the **membrane potential (Vm)** equals the **reversal potential (V_rev)** the later is defined by being the membrane potential where **net ionic current through a given channel is zero**.
> You can think of the reversal potetial as a **weighted average of the equilibrium potentials** of all permeant ions #to_verify 

## Example: The Glutamate Receptors (NMDA & AMPA)
* These are two examples of receptors with affinity for glutamate. However, as illustrated below, they behave quite differently in response to the same ligand.

	==>When glutamate is bound, AMPA receptors exhibit a rapid current flux. In contrast, NMDA receptors respond more slowly. This difference arises from the structural properties of NMDA receptors, partially due to the presence of Mg²⁺ ions in the channel pore.
* When the membrane is clamped or simply is at a very negative voltage, **Mg²⁺ acts as a physical blocker** of the NMDA channel, even if glutamate is already bound. The pore remains non-conductive because the Mg²⁺ ion is stabilized by the **negative internal potential**. 
* The only way to relieve this block is to **depolarize the membrane**. When the membrane becomes sufficiently less negative (i.e., depolarized), the **electrostatic force becomes repulsive enough to expel Mg²⁺** from the channel pore, thus permitting ion flux.I wonder if this is why it takes more time for an NMDA receptor neuron to respond compared to AMPA #wonder #to_verify

>Distinction: Depolarization is not the membrane becoming positive, but rather becoming more positive, in this case, it doesn't necessarily need to reach a net-positive voltage. Rather, **the membrane just needs to be depolarized enough** so that the internal potential no longer retains the Mg²⁺ inside the pore, in other words enoug internal cations to repell Mg²⁺

>*FIGURE 5.18* **Na+ and K+ movements during EPCs and EPPs.** 
>(A–D) Each of the postsynaptic potentials indicated at the left results in different relative fluxes of Na+ and K+ (net ion fluxes). These ion fluxes determine the amplitude and polarity of the EPCs, which in turn determine the EPPs. Note that at about 0 mV the Na+ flux is exactly balanced by an opposite K+ flux, resulting in no net current flow, and hence no change in the membrane potential. (E) EPCs are inward at potentials more negative than Erev and outward at potentials more positive than Erev. (F) EPPs depolarize the postsynaptic cell at potentials more negative than Erev. At potentials more positive than Erev, EPPs hyperpolarize the cell.
