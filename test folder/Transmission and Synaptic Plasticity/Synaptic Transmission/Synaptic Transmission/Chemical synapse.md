# Chemical synapse 

## Intro
* This is the principal type of synapse found in the adult human NS
* Unlike the electrical one , the chemical synapse is formed through many steps and incorporate intermediate agents called neurotransmitters [[Nt def]]
	=>Synaptic delay 
	
* ## **Mechanism **
	* Intro : the chemical synapse is cyclic in fashion , based on current flows but this time its mediated/controlled by molecules called neurotransmitters , it takes place after contact between two membrane (axon- dendrite spine / axon / soma) in a intermembrane environment called the **cleft**

	* Steps (*marche arriÃ¨re*)
		* 1- The vesicle is constructed by the result of action of many organelle
		* 2- The neurotransmitter is recycled via the glial cell (astrocyte) [[astrocyte role]]or destructed via enzymes [[Recycling enzymes]]
		* 3- The Nt is released 
		* 4-the Nt is fixed on the receptors associated to the ion channels allowing for the movement of current  => signal transmission 
			* the results and effects of this fixation are the holygrail to how the NS works , it depends on many factors and will be tackled in great detail starting from this note [[]]
		* 5-Nt diffuses through the cleft
		* 6-Nt release into the cleft by exocytosis of the vesicles 
		* 7-Under the passage of signal (AP), voltage gated Calcium channels opens allowing for the entrance of Ca ions inducing the : 
		* 8- Vesicles approach and fuse to the critical part of the membrane implied in the synapse

	>Rq : The probability for the signal transmission in a chemical transmission in the brain is around 5-10 % compared to almost 100% in electrical , this is validated from an evolutionary perspective [[]]
	> Rq : This process is unidirectional but it is possible to find retrograde signals in the presynaptic compartment #explanation there are some transmitters receptors in the membrane of the presynaptic cell)
