# BOTOX
## Context 
* *Clostridium Botulinum* is a bacteria that secretes a very dangerous lethal neurotoxin called  **Botulinum toxin** that causes paralyses and serious health complications, : Botulism. In short scientists have been able to control its effect and harness it in plastic surgeries and aesthetics.
## Mechanism 
* very straight forward : The toxin acts on the SNARE complex --> cleavage of the protein chains -->blockage of exocytosis --> blockage of synaptic transmission --> paralysis  --> death or wrinkles disappear
