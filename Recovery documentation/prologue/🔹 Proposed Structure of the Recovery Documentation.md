#### I. **Prologue / Meta-Preface**

- **Purpose**: why this was written, and for whom (your future self, others in recovery, researchers, etc.)
    
- **Nature of the Document**: not a guide or prescription, but a phenomenological case study in recovery, from G+0 to stability
    
- **Methodological note**: limits (n=1), strengths (depth, continuity, honesty), and the philosophy behind capturing raw vs interpreted data

#### II. **Primary Data: The Daily Logs**

- Pure, unedited, timestamped daily logs (from J+0 to current)
    
- No interpretation, no cleanup, just raw phenomenology
    
- Presented either:
    
    - **Chronologically**, or
        
    - **As micro-sections per week** with a minimal heading (e.g. _Week 2 – “Rising Frustration, Stabilization, and the GitHub Divergence”_)

#### III. **Interpretive Section: “The Deal”**

##### A. **The Landscape of Collapse (Pre-J0 context)**

- Very brief framing of what led to collapse and its nature
    
- Key stressors, lifestyle patterns, neuropsychological condition
    
- Emotional, somatic, cognitive signatures of the crash
    

##### B. **Recovery Architecture**

- Description of the system you built
    
    - Temporal microcycles (focus/rest), neuromodulator regulation, habit scaffold
        
    - Breathwork, sun exposure, shower transitions, passive recovery
        
- _What worked vs what didn’t_, with mechanistic hypotheses (where possible)
    

##### C. **Phase Analysis (Post-J0 to Plateau)**

- Segment the journey into 3–5 phases (e.g. Collapse, Dissolution, Early Rise, Fragile Clarity, Integration)
    
- For each: what marked the shift, what defined it experientially, what breakthroughs or regressions occurred
    

##### D. **Phenomenology of the “Plateau”**

- What does "plateau" feel like, what’s gained and what’s lost?
    
- How does the plateau relate to former peak performance patterns?
    
- Memory distortion and uncertainty about the “old self”
    

##### E. **Unresolvables & Unknowns**

- The chronic questions: "Is this the real me?", "Will I ever return to former peaks?", "Is sustainable performance as powerful as emergency-mode cognition?"
    
- These are left open but documented, not solved

#### IV. **Appendices / Supplementary**

- GitHub/technical notes
    
- Reflections on dopamine, breathing, environmental triggers, if you want to extrapolate to a mini-scientific framing
    
- Notes on phenomenological vision events, sensory alteration, etc.

#### V. **Postlude**

- Short closing piece reflecting on how documentation itself helped/hurt/influenced the process
    
- What’s next (the internship, re-integration, etc.)
    
- Optionally a message to future self or others in a similar place
