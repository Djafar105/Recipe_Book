this is an attempt to record and express one of the things thats been intuitivly happening to me , *and i believe to everyone*, that is vey crucial in nature  and has very little clear understanding of it , which is part of why i am doing this , to  try and decrease the fog view on this topic : Cognetive Recovery. Throughought our life we have a certain specific definition of recovery , *of course varies from one to another* , that is characterised by certain aspects , *not necessarly right , or wrong*, the goal of this documentation is to assess a model or lets say an approach to cognitive recovery , remember when we said ther are characteristics that varies from one person to another concerning the recovery phase , well before proceeding i d like to note that a man's personal recovery approach is multiple when it comes to aspects , you can see it as a bundle , in other words each recovery possesses a bundle of aspects ,.. The thing is we are almostly not aware of our bundle , of how we recover ,cognetivly speaking ofc, . In this experiment , i picked a bundle, *that is a diversified set of aspects , the choice was based on previous experiences* , and then basically i went on with it while aquiring as much data as possible on daily basis in terms of progress of the recovery proceess,. I hade two goals in mind , to preserve raw data , and then to try and make sense of it from a nerological point of view basically , two important things that id like to mention , one the bundle or lets say the protocole of the revovery in its first draft was made witht the convincion or awarness that its not perfect and thus in its making i made sure that global structure is not stricly structured and thus prone or open to change , which is what happened along the way and is very much detailed in the raw logs , second, in scienc e, i strongly believe , that its about attempting to explain sth constant , thus the natural phenomena is there and will remain unchanged throughout time but the explanation (science) is not , thus i will be preserving the raw data without treatment whatsover in order to preserve everything for a future where science is more .
the explanations will be made using my own somewhat scientifc intuitive reasoning and interpretations of the data , while ofc backed up with what i can find when it comes to resources .
one more thing that id like to mention , i think that this specefic domain , is not getting the necessary attention , cognitive performance and so cognitive revoery is very forgeginr subject ,to my knowledge, to us , avery neglected thing thats is taken for granted , people do it intuitivly , i dare say even randomly , those who are fortunate to find the right combo of aspects that works for them proceeds to be able to perform to their potential and those unfortunate are stuck in loops. thus i want to improve the accessibilty of this.
