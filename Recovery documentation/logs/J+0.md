1-so i have just , finished the exams , by brain was approaching (by the end of the last exam) borderline full crashout , but thankfully with intuitive strategic managament of the last drops of performance i was capable to carry out till last minute with normal high performance , now its 3 days past the end , i am now suffering from what i assume are the consequences , i can not focus for more thank 5-10 mins on a task , not necessarly study related , and i cant look at screens for more than 20mins , and peoples voice tires me very very quickly and so i need to shut my eyes and sleep , yes i tend to sleep a lot even if i dont need to , i have a lot of things to do but i kind of understand that i need to lay low and allow regenrations of plasticity destroyed and damaged during that period , i have no idea how long its going to take though
